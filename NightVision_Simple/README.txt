Night Vision (Always On) – Behavior Pack
========================================

What It Does
------------
This pack automatically gives *every player* Night Vision in any world where it's enabled.
No commands, no setup—just brightness everywhere, all the time.

Installation
------------
1. Download the "NightVisionBP_Simple.mcpack" file.
2. Open it (double-tap or open with Minecraft). Minecraft will import the pack.
3. In your world settings:
   - Go to "Behavior Packs"
   - Activate "Night Vision (Always On)"
4. **Important:** Cheats must be ON for this to work (required by all behavior packs that run commands).

How It Works
------------
The pack uses a built-in `/effect` command to reapply Night Vision every tick.
The effect is seamless (particles are hidden), so you won't see blinking or flicker.

Notes
-----
- Works in single-player and multiplayer.
- All players in the world will have Night Vision—cannot be toggled per player.
- If you need the ability to turn Night Vision on/off, use the "Night Vision Toggle" (Pro) pack instead.
- Incompatible with servers or realms that block custom behavior packs.
